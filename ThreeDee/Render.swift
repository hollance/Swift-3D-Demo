/*
  This app shows how to draw a 3D object without using shaders. It illustrates
  what happens behind the scenes when you use OpenGL or Metal to do 3D drawing.

  The only rendering primitive we have at our disposal is writing individual
  pixels to a bitmap.

  NOTE: Because it's a demo app, it skips a bunch of important details, but at
  least it should bring across the general idea.

  WARNING: It's pretty slow! This is not an example of how to make fast 3D gfx,
  only of how the underlying ideas work. ;-)

  To understand what happens when Metal or OpenGL draw 3D graphics, just read
  this source file from top to bottom (and run the app).

  ----------

  A high-level overview of how the app works:

  When you run the app you'll see a bouncing and spinning cube. The slider
  represents the x-position of the camera. Move the slider and the scene moves
  with it, because the camera is being repositioned in the 3D world.

  The important files in this project are:
  
  - ViewController.swift   handles the UI and animations
  - Primitives.swift       provides the setPixel() function
  - Render.swift           does all the cool stuff

  The interesting stuff happens in the function render() here in Render.swift. 
  This takes some 3D model data (a cube), transforms and projects it, and then 
  draws it by calling setPixel() over and over (which is why it is so slow).

  The ViewController has a view that is given a backing CALayer of size 800x600
  points. When you call setPixel() it draws a pixel into a 800x600 pixel bitmap
  (so drawing always happens at @1x even on Retina screens). To show this image
  on the screen, you call presentRenderBuffer(). That's all the infrastructure
  you need to know about in order to understand the rest.

  The ViewController also has a timer that calls render() every so often to 
  perform the animations. Those animations happen in its animate() method. 
  I did not want to put that animation code in Render.swift because it might
  be distracting, as it is not directly related to 3D drawing.

  So all you need to do is read through this file (Render.swift) and follow 
  along with the steps in render(). What happens in render() is roughly what 
  happens on the GPU when you tell Metal to draw 3D stuff on the screen. But
  instead of using shaders, we're doing it all by hand. :-)

// MARK: - The 3D model

/*
  First we define the model, i.e. the 3D object that we want to show. 
  
  The model is made up of triangles because triangles are easy to draw. Each 
  triangle consists of 3 vertices.
  
  A vertex describes a position in 3D space (x, y, z), but also the color of
  the triangle at that vertex, and a normal vector for lighting calculations.
  You can also add extra information such as texture mapping coordinates, as
  well as any other data you want to associate with a vertex.
  
  The coordinate system we use looks like this:
  
      y  z
      | /
      |/
      +--- x
    
  So x is positive to the right, y is postive going up, and z is positive going
  into the screen. This is a so-called left-handed coordinate system. (To get a
  right-handed coordinate system, simply flip z to -z everywhere.)
*/

struct Vertex {
  var x: Float = 0   // coordinate in 3D space
  var y: Float = 0
  var z: Float = 0

  var r: Float = 0   // color
  var g: Float = 0
  var b: Float = 0
  var a: Float = 1

  var nx: Float = 0  // normal vector (using for lighting)
  var ny: Float = 0
  var nz: Float = 0
}

/*
  A triangle has three vertices. (Another common name for this is a "face".)

  The order of the vertices in the triangle is important when face culling is 
  used, so that triangles that are facing away from the camera are not drawn.
  Get the order wrong and triangles won't show up at all!
  
  However, in this demo app we don't do face culling and so the vertex order
  doesn't really matter.

/*
  Each 3D model in the app (we only have one, the cube) is defined in its own,
  local space (aka "model space"). In order to draw these models on the screen,
  we have to make them undergo several "transformations":
  
  1. First we have to take the models and place them inside the larger 3D world. 
     This is a transformation to "world space". 
     
  2. Then we position the camera and look at the world through this camera, a
     transformation to "camera space". At this point we can already throw away
     some triangles that are not visible (culling). 
     
  3. Finally, we project this 3D view onto a 2D surface so that we can show it 
     on the screen; this projection is a transformation to "screen space" (also
     known as "viewport space").

  This is where all the math happens. To make clear what is going on, I used
  straightfoward math -- mostly addition, multiplication, the occasional sine
  and cosine. In a real 3D application you'd stick most of these calculations
  inside matrices, as they are much more efficient and easy to use. But those
  matrices will do the exact same things you see here!

  A lot of the stuff that happens in this function would normally be done by
  a vertex shader on the GPU. The vertex shader takes the model's vertices and

     And we have to project from 3D coordinates to 2D coordinates somehow, i.e.
     we need to get rid of the z-axis.

     Note that Metal does things in a slightly different order: the projection
     transform puts the vertices in "clip space" first, but we directly convert
     them to screen space. (It's the big picture that matters, not the details.)

     pass that to your vertex shader, so applying it to the vertices happens
     on the GPU.
     
     Note that the output array still contains Triangle objects even though we
     no longer use the z position of the Vertex object. As it turns out, we can
     use this z-value for a depth buffer, i.e. to determine whether to overwrite
     any existing fragments later on when we attempt to draw the triangles. */

         In a real 3D app, you'd use a projection matrix that is a bit more 
         fancy but this is the general idea.

// MARK: - Triangle rasterization

/* OK, so far what we've done is put our 3D model into the world, adjusted for
   the camera's viewpoint, and converted to 2D space. What we have now is the 
   same list of triangles but their vertex coordinates now represent specific
   pixels on the screen (instead of points in some imaginary three-dimensional
   space).

   We can draw these pixels but that only gives us the vertices, not the entire
   triangle. You can use the following function for that: it just plots three
   pixels for each triangle. (It's useful for debugging but it doesn't really
   make things look very exciting...)
*/

fileprivate func drawOnlyVertices(triangle: Triangle) {
  for vertex in triangle.vertices {
    setPixel(x: Int(vertex.x), y: Int(vertex.y),
             r: vertex.r, g: vertex.g, b: vertex.b, a: vertex.a)
  }
}

/*
   To draw the triangles we have to connect these 3 projected vertex pixels
   somehow. This is called rasterizing.
   
   Metal takes care of most of this for you. Once it has figured out which 
   pixels belong to the triangle, the GPU will call the fragment shader for 
   each of these pixels -- and that lets you change how this pixel gets drawn.
   Still, it is useful to understand how rasterizing works under the hood.
   
   To rasterize a triangle, we'll draw horizontal strips. For example, if the 
   triangle has these vertices,
   
             b


                     c

        a
   
   then the horizontal strips will look like this:
   
             =
            ====
           ========
          ============
         ========
        ====
   
   There is one strip for every vertical line on the screen, so strips are 1
   pixel high. I call these "spans".
   
   To find out where each span starts and ends, we have to interpolate between
   the y-positions of the three vertices to find the corresponding starting and
   ending x-positions, represented by asterisks in the following image:

             b
            *  *
           *      *
          *          c
         *      *
        a   *

   I called these *'s "edges". An edge represents an x-coordinate. Each span has
   two edges, one on the left and one on the right. Once we've found these two
   edges, we simply draw a horizontal line between them. Repeat this for all
   the spans in the triangle, and we'll have filled up the triangle with pixels!

   The keyword in rasterization is interpolation. We interpolate all the things!
   As we calculate these spans and their edges, we not only interpolate the 
   x-positions of the vertices, but also their colors, their normal vectors,
   their z-values (for the depth buffer), their texture coordinates, and so on.
   And when we fill up the spans from left to right we interpolate again, across
   the surface of the triangle!

   So rasterization gives us the screen coordinates of each pixel that belongs
   to a given triangle. It also gives us an interpolated color, and this is what 
   we write into the framebuffer. That last step, writing the color into the
   framebuffer, is what the fragment shader does.
   
   Metal will do all the interpolation stuff for you, and then calls a fragment
   shader for each pixel in the triangle. Of course, you can decide to do lots
   of wild things to the pixel color before you write it into the framebuffer.
   Typically, you'd apply a texture or do lighting calculations, but only your
   imagination is the limit!
